## Personal blog  


It's a personal blog where I share reading notes, development experiences from time to time. Currently, it's upgraded to Jekyll 3.0.

I rewrote most parts of the UI, mainly in LESS, I'm still looking for a great convertor or plugin to tranfer my LESS files.

For the fonts, I used __Google Fonts__  [link](https://www.google.com/fonts). If you are looking for a beautiful fonts, you __MUST__ open it!!!

And I realized that I'm really bad at designe, please tell me if you have some ideas!
