		<p>Hi there, I'm Rutian LIU, young engineer found my passion in developing, especially desk applications, web pages. Currently in <strong>Paris</strong>. </p> 
		<p>I love my work and enjoy each new project as i get it. And maybe you've noticed, I'm really obsessed with those soft colors, although I realized that I'm not good at design, so please tell me if you have great ideas to put those colors together in my blog !</p>
		<p>Besides, I really enjoy traveling and cooking, the happiest thing for me is to cook for people I care about. If you want some recipes of chinese food (spicy in my region), don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
		<p>Want to work together? I'd love to hear from you.</p>
		<p><strong>Thanks</strong> for stepping by !</p>
