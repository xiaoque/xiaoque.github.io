>It was the best of times  
It was the worst of times  
It was the age of wisdom  
It was the age of foolishness  
It was the epoch of belief  
It was the epoch of incredulity   
It was the season of Light   
It was the season of Darkness   
It was the spring of hope   
It was the winter of despair  
We had everything before us  
We had nothing before us  
We were all going direct to Heaven  
We were all going direct the other way
