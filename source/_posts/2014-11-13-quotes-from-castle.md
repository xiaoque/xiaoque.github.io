>Castle: The moment that we met,my life became extraordinary.You taught me more about myself that I knew there was to learn.You are the joy of my heart. You're the last person I want to see every night when i close my eyes.I love you, Katherine Beckett.And the mystery of you is the one i want to spend the rest of my life exploring. I promise to love you,to be your friend,and your partner in crime and life till death do us part,and for the time of our lives.
