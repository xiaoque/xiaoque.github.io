It's my 3rd new year's eve in France, yet I never spend that night in Champs-Élysées before.  

I went to Eiffel Tower in my first year's eve, and to be honest, that was really disappointed, I was told there gonna be fireworks, music, etc. So we went there like 4 hours earlier, and we were really excited counting time, and then after “3, 2, 1”, Voila! New year, and nothing… Well not really nothing happened, there were sparkling lights which we can see every night every hour.

And for this year, I hold out no hope of surprise. We arrived there around 21h, and there was so crowded with people, you could walk over their heads. But it was turned out to be totally worthy, there were light shows on Arc de Triomphe, that was awesome, I will certainly recommend my friends for this.

Although I hold my camera all the show time, I wasn't able to capture really great moment, why? Because every one has a camera! Still, I picked this photo as my favorite one. It's actually very interesting, every one is looking the light show through their cameras, well, I would say technology changed our life!
