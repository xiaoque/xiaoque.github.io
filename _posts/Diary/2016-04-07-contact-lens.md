Well I started to use lenses 7 years ago, when I was at school, I only used them in weekends and holidays, and I tried annual, quarterly, monthly, 2 weeks disposable lenses so far, and after my glasses were accidentally broken, I began to use them every day, and that makes me realize, there is difference between those lenses.  


Here, I just list those lenses I remembered , their descriptions, and what I felt about them. But as you know, lenses are often sold in a pack with 6 pairs, that really needs time to try new one.

This is my favorite one, I hardly feel it especially if I use it during weekend, but when it comes to week days, I have to look at computer all the day, so in late afternoon, I can feel my eyes become too dry, and I'm afraid they would fall out each time I blink my eyes. I think the screen has something to do with it.  

And another thing bothers me is that they are extrememy thin, so they are easily inside out, and they are so thin, those common methods to distinguish inside-out or correct oriented don't work so well.

Anyway, I'm considering to buy some daily desposable types for my holidays.
