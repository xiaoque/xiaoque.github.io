>Well I started to use lenses 7 years ago, when I was at school, I only used them in weekends and holidays, I tried annual, quarterly, monthly, 2 weeks disposable lenses so far. After my glasses were accidentally broken, I began to use them every day, and that makes me realize, there is difference between those lenses.  
<br>
Here, I just list those lenses I remembered , their descriptions, and my personal feeling. But as you know, lenses are often sold in a pack with 6 pairs, that really needs time to try new one.  

#### ACUVUE Clear

BC | DIA | Water Content| Material | Type | Price
-- | --- | -------------|----------| -----| ---
8.4|14.0 | 58%	 |Etafilcon A|Monthly Disposable | Around 18€ (6 lenses / box)
  
   
   
This is my favorite one, I hardly feel it especially if I use it during weekend, but when it comes to week days, I have to look at computer all the day, so in late afternoon, I can feel my eyes become too dry, and I'm afraid they would fall out each time I blink my eyes. I think the screen has something to do with it.  

And another thing bothers me is that they are extrememy thin, so they are easily inside out, and they are so thin, those common methods to distinguish inside-out or correct oriented don't work so well.

Anyway, I'm considering to buy some daily desposable types for my holidays.

__Conclusion:__ 

Price: ★★★★☆  
Comfortable: ★★★★☆

#### Bausch & Lomb

BC | DIA | Water Content| Material | Type | Price
-- | --- | -------------|----------| -----| ---
8.7|14.0 | 38%	 |Polymacon| half-year Disposable | Around 30€ (2 lenses / box)   

I used this one through all my university, and I only find it in China, maybe it's special model in Asia ?  

I never wore it during week days, so I can't tell whether it's comfortable or not, I chose this model is mainly because of its type. I didn't use lens very often back then, so it's waste of money if I bought monthly disposable lenses and only use 2 or 3 times a month. And I tried yearly diposable lenses before, they are not very comfortable, this one just works fine in my eyes.  


__Conclusion:__ 

Price: ★★★★☆  
Comfortable: ★★★☆☆

#### Bausch & Lomb Lacelle Color Lenses

BC | DIA | Water Content| Material | Type | Price
-- | --- | -------------|----------| -----| ---
8.6|14.0 | 42%	 |Hefilcon A| 2-week Disposable | Around 30€ (6 lenses / box)  

This is my first color lenses, I bought it in China, so the price is only for reference.  

This one is thicker than ACUVUE, makes it easier to wear, but less comfortable, I feel my eyes dry by noon, which is not enough for me, so if I wear this during week days, I have to use artificial tears to survive. Luckily, that's very easy to find in France.  

And for the color, I asked my friends, they can't tell whether I'm wearing a regular lens or color lens, but I guess that's the point -- invisible :flushed: .  

__Conclusion:__ 

Price: ★★☆☆☆  
Comfortable: ★★★☆☆

8.6|14.2 | 33%	 |Lotrafilcon B| Monthly Disposable | Around 25€ (6 lenses / box)  


I just bought this one, that material is really attractive, it's one of Silicon Hydrogels, I never tried this kind before, I'll update my thoughts later.
