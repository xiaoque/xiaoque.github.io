I'm recently updating CSS styles in my blog, and I found out some websites really useful, guess it's better to save those websites for my future changes. 
  
##### [Color Palettes](http://www.color-hex.com/color-palettes/)   
Love those palettes, really my cup of tea.

And you can actually find all the color info in the detail page of one palette.

##### [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)  

If you are looking for beautiful fonts for your website, I'm sure you can find one in here. In my blog, I mainly used these two.

I don't want change all fonts in my blog, so I chose those 2. The first one is really cute, I used it in those titles if you noticed, and the seconde one is really beautiful, I always love those handwriting fonts, and used it in quotes. I'm considering to choose one fonts more official for my contents in future changes.
